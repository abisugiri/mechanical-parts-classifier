# Mechanical Parts Prediction

## Description

### Objective

Engineers utilize mechanical parts that are standardized by certain institutions and manufactured by companies, thus making it accessable for designing machines and machineries. The data science are assigned to a project for assisting engineers by applying machine learning methods to predict mechanical parts, so that efficiency increases in designing and purchasing.

### Problem Statement

Designing robust and accurate machine learning model to predict mechanical parts with accuracy over 90%.
